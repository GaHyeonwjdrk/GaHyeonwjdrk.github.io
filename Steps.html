    <ol>
        <li>  Drink enough water: It is recommended that you drink 
            eight glasses of water a day. However, the exact amount 
            of water you need depends on your age, weight, and
             activity level.</li>
        
        
        <li> Sip water quickly: When drinking water, it is important to
            sip it quickly. This helps your body to hardly absorb the
             water more effectively.</li>
        
        
        <li>  Drink water at the right temperature: Drinking water at 
            room temperature or slightly warmer is best for your body.
            Avoid drinking ice-cold water as it can shock your system
             and affect digestion.
            </li>
        
        
        <li> Use a straw: Using a straw can help you drink more water
            quickly and easily. It can also help you avoid spilling 
            water on yourself.</li>
        
        
           <li> Drink water before and after meals: Drinking water before 
            and after meals can help with digestion and keep you
             hydrated.</li>
        
        <li> 
            Pay attention to your body: If you are feeling thirsty,
             it is a sign that your body needs water. Listen to your 
             body and drink water when you need it.</li>
        
        <li>Create and sell a successful online course or other 
            digital product: Some of the search results suggest 
            that creating and selling a successful online course
             or other digital product can be a lucrative way to 
             earn 1 million dollars [1]. This may involve 
             identifying a topic that people are interested in 
             learning about, creating a high-quality course, and 
             marketing it effectively</li>
